The Greater China focus means we pay close attention to approval mechanics and process realities that can affect importation, phaseout, and remarketing. Depending on the mandate, an exit path might be continued operation, lease novation, sale, or part-out. The right path depends on the asset's condition, records, and the buyer universe.

That mix matters because different counterparties price risk differently, operators focus on fleet fit, lessors focus on lease and residual, and teardown buyers focus on material value. Understanding who the natural buyer is helps shorten cycle time and improves closing probability. It also keeps marketing efforts focused on counterparties that can actually execute. For examples of the types of counterparties and deals, see our Recent Transactions page."

On the buy side, the focus is typically on asset selection, diligence readiness, and a clean path to delivery. On the sell side, the focus is positioning, qualified outreach, and managing execution through closing. In either case, the work is driven by the asset, the timeline, and the counterparties involved.

In the appraisal and related areas, PGA works with its partner company, Morten Beyer & Agnew, in the Greater China market. That can help connect valuation, technical reality, and market context when making timing or disposition decisions. For China-linked policy context, our PGA Perceptions reports can be a useful starting point. See Services for details.</div>

The Greater China focus means we pay close attention to approval mechanics and process realities that can affect importation, phaseout, and remarketing. Depending on the mandate, an exit path might be continued operation, lease novation, sale, or part-out. The right path depends on the asset's condition, records, and the buyer universe. The goal is to match the asset to the most realistic liquidity path.</div>

The goal is to ensure decisions are based on decision-grade inputs rather than generic assumptions. Strong records and a clear technical story usually translate into better liquidity and pricing. We can help align the technical facts with the commercial path to close.</div>

That mix matters because different counterparties price risk differently, operators focus on fleet fit, lessors focus on lease and residual, and teardown buyers focus on material value. Understanding who the natural buyer is helps shorten cycle time and improves closing probability. It also keeps marketing efforts focused on counterparties that can actually execute.
