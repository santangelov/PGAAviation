                <p><span class="career-header">Arthur P. Abel</span> retired from Boeing in 2008 as a Regional Director – Aircraft Contracts after a twenty-seven year career in which he negotiated, signed and administered commercial jetliner purchase contracts with airlines throughout the world.  During that time, he conducted contractual negotiations with twenty-nine customers large and small in thirteen countries, including eleven national flag carriers.  He spent the last eleven years of his career working exclusively with Chinese customers, including national flag carrier Air China and government aircraft purchasing agency China Aviation Supplies Import and Export Corporation (CASC).  Together with CASC, he originated, developed, and implemented the concept of the China Aircraft “Package” Framework Purchase Agreement.  That concept became the standard, still followed today, by which groups of Chinese airlines join together with CASC as a group to purchase aircraft from foreign manufacturers for their respective fleets, thereby obtaining the benefits of larger quantity purchases.  During the last several years of his career, he also served in the additional capacity as Vice President – Aircraft Contracts for Boeing China, Inc., headquartered in Beijing.</p>
